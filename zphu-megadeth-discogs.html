I am a long time lurker of r/vinyl, and this is my first post :P I am happy to have the record finally in my hands, but there is a bit of a story to it: A few years ago, I was browsing a record shop, and I had found the record (first pressing as well) for twenty bucks, and I was interested in picking it up, but I really didn't know it as well as Rust in Peace, or Countdown to Extinction, so I just picked up something else, and I would go and listen to it and learn the music I am selling the following records to cover part of the cost of an engagement ring I just bought!

Link to the Album: I have been collecting for little over a year, and probably a little too zealously. I have about 200 records, but about 25% was inherited from my dad and another 25% was  thrift store finds. Nevertheless, I have a lot of stuff that I really like. The picture is my heavy metal record collection that is quickly growing. The first metal record I ever purchased was Iron Maiden’s Piece of Mind, a great album. I found it at the local record store (Yest.
